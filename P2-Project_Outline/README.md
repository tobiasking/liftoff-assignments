# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A music forum that will be used to share, critique, and appreciate music. It will allow users to create persistent profiles, to write posts and evaluate other's posts (as well as have their own posts evaluated). The idea is focused on the concept of an emergent board focused on new music and creating communities around music. Generally, music has gravitated towards social media platforms and applications that have brought on-board social media elements - but this will be a return to the community-oriented sharing of music and a return to the way that we socialize around being exposed to new artists and having a place to revisit old favorites and classics.

Users will be able to dissent, agree, and voice their own opinions in a neutral space. Content moderation will be minimal to protect the safety of our users and abide by any legal requirements, but otherwise users will be able to voice a wide range of opinions. Posts will be able to be shared/linked to, rated, and user profiles will include activity, basic information, and the ability to subscribe to future posts from users that you might want to hear more from in the future! The site will be organized with basic FAQs and guidance on how to navigate, but will otherwise be focused on an intuitive, simplistic design that allows people to get straight to the function of the platform without unnecessary time spent navigating the page.

### What I'll Have to Learn
Would like to use Spotify API if possible, if not to share music directly to at least link user profiles to that streaming service.
Best method of making user profiles something you can subscribe to. I know RSS was used for this historically, but maybe there is a newer, better option now.
Link shortening would be awesome. Something built in that allows users to share links without verbose hyperlinks.
